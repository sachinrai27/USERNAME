       		The prevailing model for the evolution of the universe is the <a href="E:\Harvard\HTML,CSS,Django\project0\big_bang.html" class="text-decoration-none">Big Bang theory</a>. The Big Bang model states that the earliest state of the universe was an extremely hot and dense one, and that the universe subsequently expanded and cooled. The model is based on general relativity and on simplifying assumptions such as homogeneity and isotropy of space.
       		</p>
       	<h4 id="evolution">Evolution:</h4>
       		<p>
       		When the universe was very young — something like a hundredth of a billionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second (whew!) — it underwent an incredible growth spurt. During this burst of expansion, which is known as inflation, the universe grew exponentially and doubled in size at least 90 times.
			After inflation, the universe continued to grow, but at a slower rate. As space expanded, the universe cooled and matter formed.
			For the first 380,000 years after the Big Bang, however, the intense heat from the universe's creation made it essentially too hot for light to shine. Atoms crashed together with enough force to break up into a dense, opaque plasma of protons, neutrons and electrons that scattered light like fog.
			</p>
		<h4 id="fateoftheuniverse">Fate of the Universe:</h4>		
			<p>
			The fate of the universe is determined by its density. The preponderance of evidence to date, based on measurements of the rate of expansion and the mass density, favors a universe that will continue to expand indefinitely, resulting in the "Big Freeze "However, observations are not conclusive, and alternative models are still possible.
			</p>
		<h4 id="supernova">Supernova:</h4>
			<p>
			A supernova is the biggest explosion that humans have ever seen. Each blast is the extremely bright, super-powerful explosion of a <a href="E:\Harvard\HTML,CSS,Django\project0\star.html" class="text-decoration-none">star</a>.When a massive star runs out of fuel, it cools off. This causes the pressure to drop. Gravity wins out, and the star suddenly collapses. Imagine something one million times the mass of Earth collapsing in 15 seconds! The collapse happens so quickly that it creates enormous shock waves that cause the outer part of the star to explode!
