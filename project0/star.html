			Stars are huge celestial bodies made mostly of hydrogen and helium that produce light and heat from the churning nuclear forges inside their cores. Aside from our sun, the dots of light we see in the sky are all light-years from Earth.

		<h3>Life Cycle of a Star:</h3>

			The exact lifetime of a star depends very much on its size. Very large, massive stars burn their fuel much faster than smaller stars and may only last a few hundred thousand years.<br><br> Smaller stars, however, will last for several billion years, because they burn their fuel much more slowly.<br><br>
			Eventually, however, the hydrogen fuel that powers the nuclear reactions within stars will begin to run out, and they will enter the final phases of their lifetime. Over time, they will expand, cool and change colour to become red giants. The path they follow beyond that depends on the mass of the star.<br><br>
			Small stars, like the Sun, will undergo a relatively peaceful and beautiful death that sees them pass through a planetary nebula phase to become a white dwarf, which eventually cools down over time and stops glowing to become a so-called "black dwarf". Massive stars, on the other hand, will experience a most energetic and violent end, which will see their remains scattered about the cosmos in a enormous explosion, called a supernova. Once the dust clears, the only thing remaining will be a very dense star known as a neutron star, these can often be rapidly spinning and are known as pulsars. If the star which explodes is especially large, it can even form a <a href="E:\Harvard\HTML,CSS,Django\project0\blackhole.html" class="text-decoration-none">black hole</a>.

		<h3>Types of stars:</h3>	
			<div>
				<p>
				There are many different types of stars in the Universe, from Protostars to Red Supergiants. They can be categorized according to their mass, and temperature. <br>
				Stars are also classified by their spectra (the elements hat they absorb). Along with their brightness (apparent magnitude), the spectral class of a star can tell astronomers a lot about it.
